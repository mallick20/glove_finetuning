# glove_finetuning
Finetuning Glove vectors to add context. This is a study project to try and contextualize glove feature embeddings. And understand how the transformer architecture contextualizes glove vector embeddings.

We train a small transformer model over glove embeddings and train glove embeddings to be more contextual and less biased by co-occurence.
